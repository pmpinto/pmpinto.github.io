                    h2.subtitle I’m #[a.link.js-email(href="#") Pedro] and I’m a very calm and focused individual with a love for nature, minimalism and quite places.
                    p.text I’ve always enjoyed beautiful typography and delightful details that not everyone would notice. As well as setting up my own development tools and having meaningful discussions with engineers. I’m always trying to learn a few things along the way!
                    p.text Here’s a bit of my progress over the years and why you should hire me.

                        p.text During my 2.5 years at Doist I was mainly focusing on the marketing pages for both #[a.link(href="https://todoist.com/", target="_blank") Todoist] and #[a.link(href="https://twistapp.com/", target="_blank") Twist], as well as #[a.link(href="https://todoist.com/guide/premium", target="_blank") guide pages] and #[a.link(href="https://doist.com/", target="_blank") Doist’s own website]. Translating designs into web pages was one of my major tasks.
                        p.text Lately I’ve also been working on the dark theme for Todoist’s web app, having my first contact with a React/Redux environment.
                        p.text Besides all this, setting up local development tools with Gulp and fixing some bugs for the web app have also kept my heart beating.

                        p.text Worked at ESAD for 5 years and was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to find my first job at the same school I was studying.
                        p.text I started by working on a #[a.link(href="https://me.esad.pt/en/candidaturas", target="_blank") small online project] to accept applicants online—a great challenge for a newbie like I was. Meanwhile it grew internally into some kind of an intranet for some administrative actions and a place where every student/teacher could interact.
                        p.text Later we dived into Angular JS v1 and used it on a variety of projects like the website to commemorate #[a.link(href="http://www.designportugues.pt/en", target="_blank") the year of Portuguese design], the most recent #[a.link(href="https://esad.pt/", target="_blank") ESAD]’s website and also #[a.link(href="http://store.esad.pt/en", target="_blank") a store].

                        p.text In the early days, back when I was still working on my degree, some teachers reached out to me, for both my developer and designer skills.
                        p.text Some of the projects never went live and some are already dead. You can take a look at my #[a.link(href="https://dribbble.com/pmpinto", target="_blank") Dribbble] account for #[a.link(href="https://dribbble.com/shots/484196-Gallery-Draggable-items-Rebound", target="_blank") some] #[a.link(href="https://dribbble.com/shots/307512-Header", target="_blank") legacy] #[a.link(href="https://dribbble.com/shots/276975-Submenu", target="_blank") 400px] #[a.link(href="https://dribbble.com/shots/310963-Login-Screen", target="_blank") wide] #[a.link(href="https://dribbble.com/shots/464657-KeepTrack-01", target="_blank") screenshots].
                        p.text #[a.link(href="http://cl.ly/BZhI/o", target="_blank") MusicSrc] is a personal favorite of mine. It was an exercise where we were requested to implement a working blog and I ended up using WordPress.
