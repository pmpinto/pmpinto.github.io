                &lt;p&gt;Ever since I started to work, I felt like there were little things I would like to share and ramble about. A few years later I even stumbled upon a Medium article that got me into a life-changing experience. I wanted to talk about it. I wanted to share the whole experience so that someone else could benefit from the same I had benefited by reading that article.&lt;/p&gt;
